//We need an array of words to choose from
var words =["baseball","basketball","football","soccer",];
console.log(words);


//We need a button to start the game 
var button = document.querySelector




// when we press the start button it needs to select a random word from the array




// it needs to know the length of the word 





//it has to display spaces for each letter in the word 




// then when you press a letter key it needs to know what key your pressing then matching it to the blank space then displaying the letter in the blank space 




//it needs a boolean (two choices) so if there is no match then nothing happens





// and if there is a match the letter shows up in the blank spot





// if all matches are made within the timer limit it will display "You Won!" 






//and if they dont all match it will display "You Lose"







//Whether they win or loose there needs to be a button to start the game over. maybe a return? 


//We need the timer
